- setenv	Sets an environment variable, usage is "setenv variable value"
- printenv  Prints out the environment variables, usage is "printenv"
- unsetenv 	Unsets an environment varialbe, usage is "unsetenv variable".  This command will not work on "HOME" or "PATH" as they must always have a defintion.
- alias     If used as "alias" prints out the aliases, if used as "alias aliasname value" will alias aliasname to value.
- unalias   Used to unalias a value, usage is "unalias aliasname"
